# Ender 5 PLUS Direct Drive Installation
This is a modification for the Creality Ender 5 PLUS to convert it to a direct drive style hotend instead of a bowden. This is advantageous for printing flexible filaments, or for higher accuracy extrusions with less stringing.

# Overview  

This modification was tested using Neat Filaments Yellow TPU: https://3dprintingcanada.com/products/yellow-1-75mm-neat-filaments-tpu-1-kg

To perform this modification, please make sure the following criteria are met: 

1) Install the Basaraba Direct Drive kit as per the stock directions, but instead of installing the motor spacer, use the stock mounting plate from the Ender 5 PLUS filament runout sensor as a spacer. This will allow you to locate the filament runout sensor above the hotend assembly.

2) Use the stock bowden tube to add support for the hotend wiring loom. Use a second bowden tube (that loops over top of the printer) to guide the filament properly. 

3) Extend the filament runout sensor wires and route them along with the rest of the wires in the hotend wiring loom.

4) Re-orient the spool holder so it is outside of the printer box to allow greater freedom and easier access to the bowden tube. 

# Simplify3d Profile

Included in this repository is a Simplify3d profile to get you started. Please note that you may have to tweak the flow rate to get the best results with the flexibles that you are using!
